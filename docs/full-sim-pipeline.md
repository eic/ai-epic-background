# Full-Sim Pipeline

The [`simulation-pipeline`](https://github.com/eic/simulation-pipeline) submodule
orchestrates the full ePIC simulation chain end-to-end: from generator-level
HEPMC files, through afterburner beam effects, through `npsim` (Geant4) detector
simulation, through `EICrecon` reconstruction, and finally to CSV files for
downstream analysis. It is a shared repo consumed by both `ai-epic-background`
and `meson-structure`, and replaces the duplicated `full-sim-pipeline/` that used
to live in each project.

It is implemented as a small set of **Python job-creation scripts** (in the
`simulation_pipeline/` package) that consume a single per-campaign YAML config
and emit one Singularity-wrapped script per input file plus SLURM job-array
submitters. From the afterburner stage onward, stages read **dataset cards**
(small YAML files with a `files:` list) rather than globbing directories
themselves — the cards are produced by `generate_datasets` (local glob,
`--rucio`, or explicit `--files`).

## Pipeline stages

![Full-sim pipeline stages: HEPMC → convert → afterburner → npsim (edm4hep, plus saveall all-hits branch) → EICrecon (edm4eic) → dd4hep and eicrecon CSV → analysis](/diagrams/full-sim-pipeline.svg)

## Scripts

| Script                                | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `01_root_hepmc_klam_convert.py`       | ROOT → HEPMC for KLam events                              |
| `02_root_hepmc_pin_convert.py`        | ROOT → HEPMC for π⁻ events                                |
| `10_create_afterburner_jobs.py`       | Apply beam-effects afterburner to HEPMC                   |
| `11_create_background_jobs.py`        | Merge in the background cocktail (`bg_merger` stage)      |
| `20_create_npsim_jobs.py`             | Run `npsim` (DD4hep + Geant4) detector simulation         |
| `21_create_npsim_saveall_jobs.py`     | Same as above, but keeping **all** hits incl. tracking volumes |
| `22_create_npsim_background_jobs.py`  | `npsim` over background-merged HEPMC                       |
| `30_create_eicrecon_jobs.py`          | Run `EICrecon` reconstruction                             |
| `40_csv_convert.py <stage>`           | **One** CSV script for every csv stage — runs the config's converter macros (`edm4hep_*` for `csv_dd4hep`, `edm4eic_*` for `csv_eicrecon`). See [CSV Convert](/csv-convert). |
| `50_create_analysis_jobs.py`          | Run physics analysis on CSV                               |
| `51_create_root_analysis_jobs.py`     | Run physics analysis directly on ROOT                     |
| `generate_datasets.py`                | Universal dataset-card producer (local glob / `--rucio` / `--files`) |
| `datasets.py`                         | Card schema, config loader, `run_card_pipeline`           |
| `rucio.py`                            | Rucio dataset discovery (official campaigns)              |
| `job_creator.py`                      | Shared `JobCreator` class — see [Job Creator](/full-sim-pipeline-jobs) |
| `scripts/collect_job_stats.py`        | Aggregate timings / exit codes across a campaign          |

Each `NN_*.py` stage script is the same shape: load the YAML config, read the
stage's dataset cards, render one container script per input file, and emit SLURM
job-array submitters. The two former CSV scripts
(`40_create_csv_dd4hep_jobs.py` / `41_create_csv_eicrecon_jobs.py`) are now the
single `40_csv_convert.py <stage>`; which converters run is entirely the config's
`<stage>.macros` list.

## Configuration

Each campaign has its own self-contained YAML file under `configs/`, e.g.:

- `config-msf-26-07.yaml`            — meson-structure, 26.07
- `config-msf-26-07-background.yaml` — meson-structure with background cocktail
- `config-off-26-06.yaml`            — official campaign (RECO already on Rucio)

These files set the campaign's base directory, container image, beam energies,
event count, per-stage input/output paths, and each csv stage's `macros:` list.
There is no inheritance — open one file and you see the whole picture. See the
[Campaigns page](/full-sim-pipeline-campaigns) for details and conventions.
